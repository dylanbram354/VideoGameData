# Overview

This was a bonus project for devCodeCamp, given to me as an additional exercise after completing another project a few days before it was due. This Django web application consumes an API that returns data about video games. Users can search for games, view their details, and view various chart visualizations of video game data powered by Chart.js.

### Technologies
- Python + Django
- Chart.js
- HTML, CSS, Bootstrap
